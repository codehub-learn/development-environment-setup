&nbsp;

## Workstation specifications

## Development IDE
**[Download IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)** and install. If you already have it installed and your license has expired, we will provide you with a valid license for the duration of the course. If you prefer using another IDE, that's also fine as the examples do not use any IDE-specific functionality. 

## Java Development Tools
1. Java Development Toolkit, download and install one the latest LTS version **[JDK 21 or JDK 25](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/)**. Create an environmental variable named **JAVA_HOME** pointing to the JDK installation folder.
2. Maven, download **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)** and follow the **[instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)**. Through the Maven dependency management mechanism, we will download every library needed in our projects.  Create an environmental variable named **MVN_HOME** pointing to Maven's installation folder.
3. Add **%JAVA_HOME%\bin** and **%MVN_HOME%\bin** to your **PATH** envrionmental variable.

## Other tools
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.
