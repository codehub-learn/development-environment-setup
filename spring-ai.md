## Development IDE

**[Download IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)** and install. If you already have it
installed and your license has expired, we will provide you with a valid license for the duration of the course. If you prefer using another
IDE, that's also fine as the examples do not use any IDE-specific functionality.

## Java Development Tools

1. Java Development Toolkit, download and install one the latest LTS version **[JDK 21 or JDK 25](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/)**.
   Create an environmental variable named **JAVA_HOME** pointing to the JDK installation folder.
2. Maven, download latest **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)** distribution and follow the *
   *[instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)**. Through the Maven dependency management mechanism, we will download every
   library needed in our projects. Create an environmental variable named **MVN_HOME** pointing to Maven's installation folder.
3. Add **%JAVA_HOME%\bin** and **%MVN_HOME%\bin** to your **PATH** envrionmental variable.
