# React Native

## System Requirements

Before starting please make sure that you have successfully installed the below dependencies on your development environment.

- The latest **LTS** version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.JS is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/). Check the instructions [here]((https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) for across various OS and pick the installation setup based on the OS you use for local development.

## Code editor

Feel free to use any IDE you like. **However, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended IDE** since it is light-weight, has a ton of extensions/plugins, and it is an industry standard.
