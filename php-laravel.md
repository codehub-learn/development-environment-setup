## Starter Kit and Resources for PHP Laravel

We will create a modern web application with:

- [PHP 8.2](https://www.php.net/downloads)
- [MySQL 8](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/8.0.html)
- [Laravel 11](https://laravel.com/)

## Local Environment Setup
You need to follow some steps to run [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) on your machine:

1. Install [PHP 8.2](https://www.php.net/downloads)

2. Install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) locally

3. For this workshop, we will use Docker through [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail). Laravel provides Sail, a built-in solution for running your Laravel project using Docker. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a tool for running applications and services in small, light-weight "containers" that do not interfere with your local machine's installed software or configuration. This means you don't have to worry about configuring or setting up complicated development tools such as web servers and databases on your local machine. To get started, you must first install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

4. Once done with Docker Desktop, please check the instructions for Laravel across various OS [here](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/installation#docker-installation-using-sail) and pick the installation setup that much the OS you use for local development

### Code editor 

Feel free to use any IDE you like. **However, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended IDE** since it is light-weight, has a tone of extensions/plugins, and it is an industry standard.
