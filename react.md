# React Front-end development

## System Requirements

Before starting please make sure that you have successfully installed the below dependencies on your development environment.

- The latest **LTS** version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.JS is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - is the official Nodejs Package Manager (npm) which allows the management of dependencies and packages. It is automatically installed with nodejs, so you don't have to install it separately.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) / [GitHub account](https://github.com/) - is a version control system for source code and GitHub is a community site that enables the easy creation and collaboration on Git projects.

## Verifying installation

After installing node please verify that you have set up everything correctly by typing the below commands on your terminal:

- `node -v` ➡️ (latest LTS version),
- `npm -v` ➡️ (latest LTS version).

## Code editor

Feel free to use any IDE you like. **However, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended IDE** since it is light-weight, has a ton of extensions/plugins, and it is an industry standard. 

VS Code will be used within class with the following extensions:

- [Babel JavaScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [npm Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense)
- [Path Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ionutvmi.path-autocomplete)
- [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)
- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
