# Hardware and software requirements for Java Standard Edition development (Java SE 21)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


## Development IDE
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition is the recommended IDE (if you already have the Ultimate edition, you do not need to do anything else). 

Download IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition **[for Windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC)** or **[for Mac](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=macM1&code=IIC)** or **[for Linux](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=linux&code=IIC)** and install. If you prefer a different IDE, that is also fine as the examples do not make use of any IDE specific functionality. Support in the training, however, can only be provided for IntelliJ.

## Java Development Tools
1. Download and install the Java LTS version 21 from this location **[JDK 21 downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)**. Create then an environmental variable named **JAVA_HOME** pointing to JDK installation folder. Earlier versions of Java are not compatible with the course content, but if you already have them on you machine, you do not need to uninstall them.

3. Add **%JAVA_HOME%\bin** and **%MVN_HOME%\bin** to your **PATH** envrionmental variable.

## Other tools
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** (free software). If you have an older version of git, it is highly recommended that you update to the latest version.
2. Create a **[Github account](https://github.com/join)** if you don't already have one (free to use).
