## Recommended Setup ⚒️

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or WebStorm
- Node.js
- npm
- Git

## Installation instructions 📑

1. Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor. Alternatively, you can download [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) from the JetBrains website.
2. Download and install an **LTS** version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). To verify that you have installed it
   correctly type the command `node -v` in a command line window and it should display the installed version of Node.js

   > Angular applications require an LTS version of Node.js in order to work properly.

3. **Npm** is already included in Node.js. To verify that you have it, type the command `npm -v` in a command line
   window and it should display the installed npm version.

   > Windows users: if the previous command is not working, verify that the path of the npm executable has been added to
   your PATH environment variable.

4. If you do not already have Git installed, navigate to https://git-scm.com/downloads, download the appropriate version
   for your environment and install it.
