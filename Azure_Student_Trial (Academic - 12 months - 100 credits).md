# Instructions for creating an educational Azure Account

In order to follow the course(s), you will need to have credits in your Azure account. One of the easiest ways to obtain these credits is by applying for an Azure for Students subscription through the following [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/).

## Required Setup
- Academic E-mail OR
- AthTech E-mail

## Step-by-step

1. Head to the [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) and click on the "Start Free" button:

2. There are two cases that may happen:

    - You are not logged in and you will be required to sign in with your academic account:

    - You are already logged in with another account. Sign out of that account and use your academic account:

3. After signing in, you will be redirected to an Academic Verification Form. Select the relevant Country where the School is based, the School Name and input your Date of Birth. For AthTech Emails select "Greece" and "Athens Tech College (Μενεμένη)".

4. After the Verification process is complete, you will be requested to fill in your profile. Input your country of residence, your address and a phone number. Input your real phone number as Azure will verify it.

    Note: ****Use a unique phone number, do not reuse a phone number that has been used for the creation of another Azure Account (whether that is trial or not). Same applies for the secondary e-mail.****
