## Python
**Download** and **install** the latest [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) vesrion.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> During installation, **add python to your environmental variables**. That means that you have to check the box saying **ADD TO PATH** on the **first screen** during the installation

> [!NOTE]
> If prompted select to additionally install pip.

> [!CAUTION]
> We do **not** recommend using other python distributions (e.g. anaconda). 

***Verify that python is installed***
    - Open a command prompt and type the command for launching a python interpreter. Depending on the OS and python's version this can either be `python`, `python3`, `py` or `py3`.
    - If none work, you need to add python to your environmental variables manually. To do this, find the interpreter in the installation directory and [add it as an environmental variable](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm).
    - From now on we'll consider that python is installed and works with the command `python`. If this differs in your PC, use your own instead of `python` from now on.
