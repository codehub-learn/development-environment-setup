1. Verify that python is installed.
    - Open a command prompt and type the command for launching a python interpreter. Depending on the OS and python's version this can either be `python`, `python3`, `py` or `py3`.
    - If none work, you need to add python to your environmental variables manually. To do this, find the interpreter in the installation directory and [add it as an environmental variable](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm).
    - From now on we'll consider that python is installed and works with the command `python`. If this differs in your PC, use your own instead of `python` from now on.
2. Verify that pip is installed.
    - Pip is a package manager for Python.
    - Open a command prompt and type the command `pip`.
    - If it doesn't exist type `python -m pip`. If this works, you can add pip to your environmental variables (look above on how to do this). `
    - If pip isn't installed, download the installer from [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run it as a python scripy: `python get-pip.py`.
3. Packages required during this course can be installed using the pip package manager. Either `pip install package-name` or `python -m pip install package-name`. Any package that is required will be pointed out and installed in class.
